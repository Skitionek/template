### Changed

- `lint.yml` MegaLinter now auto-selects the appropriate flavor (python, javascript, java, go, ruby, php, rust, dotnet, terraform, swift, or `all`) based on changed file extensions; mixed-language PRs fall back to `all` ([#PR])
- `copilot-auto-fix.yml` now runs GitHub Copilot CLI directly on the runner to fix failing tests and opens a fix PR, instead of posting a `@copilot` comment

### Added
